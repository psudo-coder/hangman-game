# Hangman Game

This was inspired by an exercise from the course [The Modern Javascript Bootcamp](https://github.com/psudo-dev/javascript-bootcamp-andrew-mead). But as an exercise, I tried to rewrite it from scratch, as a mid-course self challenge.

## About <a name = "about"></a>

Some of the mechanism of the game is basically the same we had in class, but I've tried to make it into a real game. So I added a starting page, useful messages to the player and also a game summary.

Since it doesn't really ressemble the [original exercise](https://github.com/psudo-dev/javascript-bootcamp-andrew-mead/tree/master/hangman-game) I decided to host it in a separated repository.
